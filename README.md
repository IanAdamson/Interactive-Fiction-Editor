Interactive-Fiction-Editor
==========================

A tool to assist in the creation of dialog trees for interactive fiction (things lie Choose Your Own Adventure books or visual novels)

Requires PHP 5 and MySQL - make a database and a new table using the SQL schema, then edit src/inc/database.php to point to it.

**Security warning**: this tool should not be run on a public server as-is. It is not feature complete and there's no user authentication.

TODO: Finish making sure all SQL is switched over to MySQLi.
