Interactive-Fiction-Editor
==========================

A tool to assist in the creation of dialog trees for interactive fiction (things lie Choose Your Own Adventure books or visual novels)

Requires PHP 5 and MySQL - make a database and a new table using the SQL schema, then edit src/inc/database.php to point to it.

Security warning: this tool was not designed to run on a public server, and isn't really designed with security in mind. There's no user authentication or anything like that (yet), and the tool isn't feature complete.
